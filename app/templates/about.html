		</ol>
	</p>

	<h2>Contributors</h2>
	<p>Our contributors so far include:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Brandon Walker (aka, <b>the creator</b>)</li>

	<h2>Origin</h2>
	<p>This blog started as a practice project by <b>the creator</b> for
		Miguel Grinburg's
		<a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-
		part-i-hello-world" target="_blank">Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>. From there,
		the blog continued to develop as <b>the creator</b> saw the need for a
		place to clarify and develop his thoughts on philosophy, code, law,
		politics, and religion, and thought it would be best to do this in a way
		that was guided by two ancient and wise principles of ethics:<br><br>

		Thus, the blog expanded to add further contributors and continues to add
		new features as <b>the creator</b> learns more about HTML/CSS and Flask.
